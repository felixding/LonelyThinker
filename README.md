# LonelyThinker
The missing blog platform for geeks

The project was first started in 2006 or 2007, when I wanted to learn Ruby on Rails, but eventually I went back to PHP ([CakePHP](https://cakephp.org)) and used it to develop this project.

It's a full-featured blogging software with some unique features:

- M-O: It's a SPAM classifer using the Naive Bayes algorithm. It worked extremely well on my blog and stopped over 300k SPAM comments, IIRC.
- VisitSense: A pluggable "trigger/action" system that performs certain actions on predefined visitors' behaviors. For example, I used it to show a specific welcome message to my friends if they come from certain IPs/referrals. The purpose of the feature is to boost user engagement.

I had written [some](https://dingyu.me/blog/lonely-thinker-0405) [posts](https://dingyu.me/blog/lonelythinker-04) introducing LonglyThinker on my blog, which was quite popular in the Chinese tech community back then.

I stopped developing and maintaining LonelyThinker from about 2012. The reason was I was tired of fully dynamic blogging tools and switched back to static HTML files, like what I did in late 1990s and early 2000s. I'm still using static HTML files for my blog, as of now.

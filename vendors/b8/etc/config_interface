### Configuration for a shared database connection ###

# If you use the same database backend for the work database and b8's
# database (e. g. MySQL in both cases), then you can set your access data
# in config_storage_work and shareConnection to TRUE. Then, the database
# link created by the work storage backend will also be passed to b8's
# storage backend.
